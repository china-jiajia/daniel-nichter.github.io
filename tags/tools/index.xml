      <description>When we write a new tool to do X, it&amp;rsquo;s common to program the tool to do X in one way. When X is trivial or very narrow in scope, this makes sense, and programming any more would fall prey to over-engineering. However, when the tool does many things (all logically related, else it falls prey to bloat and/or feature-creep), there quickly becomes many ways to accomplish those many things.</description>
