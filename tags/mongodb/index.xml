      <title>MongoDB Bulk Insert Error Handling</title>

      <description>Half a year ago, I reported a MongoDB server bug: SERVER-29861. Yesterday, we effectively finally closed it. First, my thanks to Asya and the MongoDB dev team for the thorough discussion and exploration of this issue, which was ultimately concluded not to be a bug. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see MongoDB dig deep until the issue reaches bottom. As someone who formerly maintained a large, widely used open-source project for several years, I know how difficult this can be.</description>

      <title>Custom MongoDB Replica Set Write Concern</title>

      <description>One of the great things about MongoDB is write concern:
 Write concern describes the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for write operations to a standalone mongod or to replica sets or to sharded clusters.
 Awesome! I want 1 write ack from any secondary in the primary DC so when the primary crashes we&amp;rsquo;re guaranteed to have an up-to-date secondary in the primary DC ready to be elected primary.</description>
