      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a developer who hasn&amp;rsquo;t read or reviewed a lot of code written by other developers. If there&amp;rsquo;s one truism in the field of software of engineering it&amp;rsquo;s that the process is collaborative. Unless you write and never release software, other people will read the code, and they&amp;rsquo;re most likely reading it not for a fun bedtime story but because they need to understand and probably fix or modify it.</description>

      <title>Designing Tools for Integration</title>

      <description>When we write a new tool to do X, it&amp;rsquo;s common to program the tool to do X in one way. When X is trivial or very narrow in scope, this makes sense, and programming any more would fall prey to over-engineering. However, when the tool does many things (all logically related, else it falls prey to bloat and/or feature-creep), there quickly becomes many ways to accomplish those many things.</description>

      <title>How To Test the Database</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How do I test the database?&amp;rdquo; is a question I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by colleagues many times. There&amp;rsquo;s a good, clean solution, but let&amp;rsquo;s first step back from what seems to be the problem to unpack why &amp;ldquo;testing the database&amp;rdquo; is not special (but nonetheless important). In other words: colleagues don&amp;rsquo;t ask, &amp;ldquo;How do I test such-and-such package?&amp;rdquo;, because that&amp;rsquo;s common and well understood. The question about testing the database implies that the database is a special beast that, if not treated properly, will devour the developer in their sleep.</description>

      <title>Design Before Implementation</title>

      <description>Like most software engineers, I review my colleagues&amp;rsquo; code. I rarely provide feedback on implementation details because developers rarely choose obviously bad implementations. I focus my attention on design rather than implementation for one simple reason: implementation details are easy to change when software is well designed. Or, from the business perspective, design is the most costly aspect of software to change, so I review for great and therefore cost-effective design.</description>
