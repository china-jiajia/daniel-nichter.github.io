      <description>New engineers might not know and experienced engineers might not believe that database systems do not and cannot scale gracefully to 100% system capacity but, rather and counterintutively, exhibit retrograde performance at some point less than 100% system capacity. The reasonable presumption is:
We presume that a database can scale to almost 100% of system capacity, and max performance is a small fraction at the very top (right, orange slice) because, after all, the system itself needs some resources to run itself.</description>
