      <description>New engineers might not know and experienced engineers might not believe that database systems do not and cannot scale gracefully to 100% system capacity but, rather and counterintutively, exhibit retrograde performance at some point less than 100% system capacity. The reasonable presumption is:
We presume that a database can scale to almost 100% of system capacity, and max performance is a small fraction at the very top (right, orange slice) because, after all, the system itself needs some resources to run itself.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;How do I test the database?&amp;rdquo; is a question I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by colleagues many times. There&amp;rsquo;s a good, clean solution, but let&amp;rsquo;s first step back from what seems to be the problem to unpack why &amp;ldquo;testing the database&amp;rdquo; is not special (but nonetheless important). In other words: colleagues don&amp;rsquo;t ask, &amp;ldquo;How do I test such-and-such package?&amp;rdquo;, because that&amp;rsquo;s common and well understood. The question about testing the database implies that the database is a special beast that, if not treated properly, will devour the developer in their sleep.</description>
