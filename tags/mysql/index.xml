      <title>When MySQL Goes Away</title>

      <description>Handling MySQL errors in Go is not easy. There are a lot of MySQL server error codes, and the Go MySQL driver as its own errors, and Go database/sql has its own errors, and errors can bubble up from other packages, like net.OpError. Consequently, Go programs tend not to handle errors. Instead, they simply report errors:
err := db.Query(...).Scan(&amp;amp;v) if err != nil { return err }  And then the error is logged or reported somewhere.</description>

      <title>Crash-safe MySQL Replication</title>

      <description>MySQL crash-safe replication is an old feature (~4 years as of MySQL 5.6), but it&amp;rsquo;s not consistently understood or applied. The MySQL manual on the topic, 16.3.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replication Slave, is correct and authoritative, but unless you grok MySQL replication that page doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it obvious why crash-safe replication works. Other blog posts explain why, but sometimes add other considerations, making it unclear which settings are necessary and sufficient.</description>
